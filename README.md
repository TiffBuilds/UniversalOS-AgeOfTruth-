## 🌌 What is UniversalOS?

An open-source civic operating system designed to align systems with the promises they make.  
No more cosplay. No more legacy performances. Just structures that serve, receipts that match.

## 🚀 Core Components

- **Clarity Engine** — receipts match the blueprint, transparency is always-on  
- **Transparency Layer** — decisions, data, and functions open by default  
- **Jubilee Engine** — resets baked in, not crisis-driven  
- **Symbol Dashboards** — symbols that show alignment, not hide gaps  
- **Open collaboration** — belongs to everyone

## 🖖 Our Pledge

Out of many, one — for real this time.  
No slogans. No cosplay. Just clarity.

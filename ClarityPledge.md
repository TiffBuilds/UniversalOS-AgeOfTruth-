# ðŸ–– AGE OF TRUTH â€” CLARITY PLEDGE

We donâ€™t build costumes.  
We donâ€™t build mascots.  
We donâ€™t build slogans without substance.

We build systems that match their promise.  
We build tech that enhances reality, not disguises it.  
We build symbols that show, not hide.  

No more cosplay over clarity.  
No more performance over purpose.  
No more puppets over people.

Out of many, one â€” for real this time.
